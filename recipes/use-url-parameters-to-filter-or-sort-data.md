Use URL Parameters to Filter or Sort Data
=========================================

Question
--------

How can you pass parameters in the URL to filter data when requesting a collection?

Answer
------

`Collection Query String whitelist` under `REST Parameters` in the Admin UI, or its analogue
`collection_query_whitelist` key within `zf-rest` in `module.config.php`, whitelists query string
arguments, allowing their value to be received by your REST resource's `fetchAll($params = array())`
method.

This can be useful if you need to allow visitors to filter or search the collection, such as:

- `http://localhost:8000/autocomplete?state=mis`
- `http://localhost:8000/books?title=php&sort=year`

Whitelisting arguments also allows `zf-rest` to automatically include those parameters in the
`self`, `first`, `last`, `prev` and `next` hypermedia links when returning a collection.

> documentation](/modules/zf-rest) for more information on how to use
> `collection_query_whitelist`.
